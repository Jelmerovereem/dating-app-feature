My feature for the dating-app

## Job story / feature
My job story is about a user that an look up is favorite movies and TV-series and can add these to his/her profile page. So people can see in what movies/tv-series you are interested in and can talk about it.

## Getting started
You need to have a connection with Git and have nodejs installed on your computer to let this project run.

Clone my repository first with adding this line into your terminal:

2. Install the node modules / packages
You have to install the node modules that the project requires.
Put the following line of code into your terminal:
